You must display this permit at your campsite or tent pad throughout your stay. For frontcountry and backcountry campgrounds, you can get a permit two ways:</p><ul><li>If you make an online reservation, simply print out your confirmation email</li><li>Otherwise, you can get a permit when you check-in at the campground</li></ul><p>For camping in backcountry areas that do not have reservable campgrounds, a backcountry camping permit may be required. For most backcountry areas that require a permit, it is possible to self-register at major trailheads.&nbsp;</p><p>Some parks accept advance registration for backcountry permits. Not all these parks have self-registration facilities, so registering in advance is strongly recommended where possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Some parks require a fee for backcountry permit registration. Fees can be pre-paid at parks that accept pre-registration, so you do not need to bring cash to the park. You must bring cash if visiting a park with self-registration at the trailhead.&nbsp;</p><blockquote style=\"background-color:#ededed;border-radius:8px;border:5px solid #ededed;\"><p>To see if you need a permit, if you can advance register, and whether there is a fee <a href=\"/explore\">find your park’s webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Even if you book in advance, a backcountry camping permit is not a reservation.
